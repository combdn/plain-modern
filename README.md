# Plain Modern Theme

A light theme with almost no highlighting for [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com). It is based on the default Light Modern theme. I use it with [JetBrains Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chadalen.vscode-jetbrains-icon-theme).

## Motivation

If you highlight everything, you highlight nothing. My brain just struggles to parse regular themes. Also, I cannot comprehend information in dark mode.

So the Plain Theme only separates comments from code. A little touch is highlighting the matching brackets and folded sections. And of course, itâ€™s a light theme.
